# Ethereal Framework [PHP]

The keywords and structure are inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

Most of the use case might be SIMILAR but it's not based on Laravel.

Some features are based on Laravel while mostly are the naming convention.

We would like to recommend to read the documentation for your development.
